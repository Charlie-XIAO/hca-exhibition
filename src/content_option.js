They were a Neolithic civilization that existed around 3500 B.C. Archeologists revealed stone tombs and ritual stone platforms in Liaoning, as well as jade creatures that they named “pig dragons”, or “玉龙猪”. This artifact is one of the earliest depictions of a dragon in the history of Chinese art. As we can see, the pig dragon is curved, and the art piece is C-shaped with a hole in the middle. It has a scrunched nose, and almost has an angry appearance. According to Google Arts and Culture, this artifact also resembles an animal embryo, so it potentially represents a pure form of life force or a symbol of vitality. Jade is also a symbol of high status, therefore whoever owned this pig dragon was someone of importance.",

The dragon is a symbol of power, strength, and good luck in Chinese culture. The dragon motifs on bi discs from the Han dynasty and later periods are particularly notable for their complexity and beauty. The dragons are typically depicted amidst clouds, symbolizing their celestial nature and control over rain and water. The craftsmanship involved in creating these motifs was highly sophisticated, especially considering the hardness of jade and the lack of metal tools during the Neolithic period. The artisans would have used techniques such as abrasion and polishing to achieve the intricate designs.",

These dragons, crafted from jade, showcase the expertise of skilled artisans. Their smooth designs feature intricate details, indicating the use of tools such as saws, grinders, and drills for the carving process. We can assume from their substantial size, thickness, precise craftsmanship, and glossy finish that they were likely commissioned by aristocrats, labeled as a luxury good. The pendants likely hung from the owner's shoulders or waistband, as indicated by holes pierced through the creatures' hindquarters. Dragon motifs were seen often during the Bronze Age. Contemporary texts suggest that dragons were not only decorative but were also seen as supernatural beings. When buried with the dead, jade pendants might have symbolized the belief that dragons could carry the human soul to the afterlife. This illustrates people's theories of life and death at that time.",

They dived into a pool, and out flew two dragons a little later, leaving a raging storm in their wake. Back to the artifact, known as the siling, or "four spirits," the Green Dragon of the East, White Tiger of the West, Red Bird of the South, and Dark Warrior of the North are the animals of the four directions. The sinuous, undulating body of the Green Dragon moves forward as he raises his rear haunches and springs into action. His elongated jaw and open mouth end in fork-shaped lips. His horns or ears are perked back into curls. The clawed feet of three legs seem to shovel the air forward in frenetic motion while his uppermost leg reaches toward his mouth.',

    desc: 'Roofs are thought to serve as conduits for communication between the living and spirit realms in ancient Chinese belief. As a result, they were adorned to fend off evil and serve as a magnet for good fortune and benefits. The phrase "Liuli Wa," which means "roof-tile of glass," refers to glazed tile work in China and dates back to the Tang Dynasty (618-906), however Tang tiles are now extremely rare. Although the soft earthenware used to produce Ming tiles varies, it frequently has an irregular composition and a high grog content. The tiles have a fully handmade appearance with plenty of fine detail and undercutting since they were mold built with a lot of hand working. Because they were low fired and coated with lead glaze, the glaze frequently runs. Two primary color schemes were used: the darker Fahau palette (turquoise, blue, and purple) and the Sancai palette (greens, yellows, and browns). Chinese glazed tiles were produced over a long period of time with minimal alteration, making dating them challenging. It\'s not helpful to know when the building they originated from was constructed because tiles required to be replaced periodically due to exposure to the weather, therefore a structure may have tiles that were created throughout several centuries. Nonetheless, a rough date may be deduced from the study, and it is possible to distinguish replacement tiles from the authentic Ming instances.',

He firmly adopted the five-clawed dragon as his emblem of imperial power, and this became the standard emblem for all Ming emperors and an indicator of imperial flavor. Four and three-clawed were then relegated to being representation of lower rank. Emperors referred to themselves as the "Dragon Son of Heaven."【真龍天子】It was mandated that only the emperor\'s personal items and clothing could depict the image of the five-clawed dragon, while elsewhere, the figure of a serpent (since serpents have four claws and dragons have five) was used for differentiation.',

During this period, moonflask handles were applied in the shapes of prehistoric animals, birds, and flora. During the Qing dynasty, deliberate efforts were made to replicate the painting style of the early Ming period. The look of early 15th-century blue and white fascinated porcelain painters of the 18th century so much that they created a unique painting technique to mimic the unintentional flaws of their models: they replicated the so-called "heaped and piled" effect of darker spots of cobalt blue by purposefully uneven dotting.
